        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple way to make your own perfect aioli. Goes well with both Moules Frites and pizza crust. Boom</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil (rapeseed, olive, opinions differ. I usually go with rapeseed or sunflower. Or olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt - a pinch</li>
            <li>Egg yolks - maybe two. Depends on how much aioli you want</li>
            <li>Vinaegar or lemon juice. Or lime juice if you're trying to not upset any puritans. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix yolks with acid of your choice (preferably not THAT kind of acid though)</li>
            <li>Chrush or finely chop garlic and mix into the... mix(?)</li>
            <li>Whip it while your pouring oil into it. A very very thin stream of oil. Super thin. Very important. Ask anyone</li>
            <li>Done. Taste with salt and black pepper</li>

            
                
        </ol>
